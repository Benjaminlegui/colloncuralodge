      With annual returns of 50,000+ fish and an average size exceeding 8
      pounds, no other river in the world can rival the Rio Grande in
      Argentina's southern territory of Tierra del Fuego as the best place on
      the planet to catch sea-run brown trout. Combine the river with the best
      returns and the largest average size of sea-run brown trout with easy
      access to 12 miles of rested pools from a comfortable homestyle lodge
      designed for four (4) anglers per week, and that’s the San Jose Lodge
      fishing experience.

      Studies have shown that sea-run brown trout can return to the Rio Grande
      over four times to spawn during their lifecycle and reach a weight that
      exceeds 20+ pounds. With an average size exceeding 8+ pounds it’s truly a
      privilege to fish the Rio Grande for this remarkable strain of sea-run
      brown trout.

      It’s without question that the rivers on the island of Tierra del Fuego in
      southern Argentina are among the most productive sea-run brown trout
      fisheries in the world. Many suggest that the Rio Grande has a large
      average size and high annual return rates of sea trout because of the lack
      of commercial fishing, rich marine rearing environment, and strictly
      managed catch and release fishing policy.
