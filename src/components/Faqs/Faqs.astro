    title: "How do I get there?",
    description:
      "Any major hub in the US will offer direct flights to Buenos Aires Argentina, and then depending on your final destination, you are almost always just one short flight away from the finish line! We will help you choose the correct flights and coordinate any ground transfers you may need. With our help, travel is a breeze.",

    title: "What should I bring?",

    title: "When should I go?",

    title: "How long should my trip be?",
    description:
      "This answer will heavily depend on your choices of lodges, fishing methods, and target species. The ideal itinerary is at least 7 days in-country. This allows you to experience at least 2-3 locations at a relaxed pace. The customized nature of our itineraries makes this entirely dependent on your wants and needs.",

    title: "Why Northern Patagonia?",
    description:
      "Northern Patagonia is a fly fisherman's paradise. With fisheries as prolific and productive as any American fishery with a fraction of the traffic. Often compared to Montana 80 years ago, imagine fishing the Madison, Missouri, Big Horn, White, or any other, and only seeing a handful of other fishermen the entire day. That is truly what separates this region from any other.",
