        Probably the most consistent and productive river In Northern Patagonia.
        The Collon Cura river is nestled in a high desert valley, this river
        emerges as a gem in the realm of fishing. Its productivity is on par
        with the Worldâ€™s best. However, it maintains its allure with notably
        fewer crowds. Resembling the picturesque Snake River near Jackson Hole,
        its banks are adorned with willows, complemented by towering sandstone
        cliffs. Here, the river's gentle gradient and expansive gravel rifles
        offer an inviting setting for both floating and wading enthusiasts with
        a structure that can accommodate any level of physical capability.

        Various methods find success on the Collon Cura. Big dry flies prove
        particularly effective when deftly presented along the banks and
        skillfully navigated through the riffles and runs. During still
        mornings, trout rise gracefully in the tailouts, eddies, and soft
        waters, feasting on mayfly spinners. As dusk descends, a vibrant caddis
        hatch emerges, enticing strikes with patterns like the elk hair or
        goddard caddis deftly danced across the water's surface. Yet, perhaps
        the most rewarding tactic remains the art of streamer fishing, a method
        yielding bountiful catches throughout the seasons.

        Flowing from the Pichi Picun Leufu dam and meandering for approximately
        60 miles before converging into the expansive Chocon Reservoir. Its
        grandeur is reflected in its formidable size, with flow rates ranging
        from 7,000 cfs to 16,000 cfs, contingent upon the demands of electricity
        production. Renowned as perhaps the most dynamic waterway in the
        province, the lower Limay presents anglers with a diverse and vibrant
        ecosystem sustained by the pristine, cool waters discharged from the
        dam.

        This river harbors an exceptionally tough population of rainbow trout,
        renowned for their fighting prowess averaging between 17 to 21 inches
        nourished year-round by a bountiful diet of aquatic insects and minnows.
        Moreover, the lower Limay beckons with the promise of giant resident and
        migratory brown trout, ranging from 20 to well over 30 inches in length.
        Over the years, clients have triumphantly reeled in behemoths surpassing
        the 30-inch mark. These majestic creatures grace the river throughout
        the season, with the latter half heralding peak productivity and angling
        opportunities.
